# Overview

Reccy is a simple nmap wrapper written in go. It allows you to enumerate ports in a machine creating an organized directory structure to hold the output.

**Important:** This tool was written for the PWK course from Offensive Security. Keep in mind that I'm no expert if you're using in the wild: it might crash unstable systems.

# Build

To build run

```
go build -o reccy *.go
```

# Usage

Specifying an ip address is required. 


```
Usage: ./reccy [options] -ip <target>
    
    -ip string
        [Required] Target IP of the machine to scan
    -light
        [Optional] Perform a light scan of top 20 ports only. If not set, it will perform a scan of 65535 ports of the target.
```
